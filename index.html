                  Okay, so let's see if I can properly put this into words...
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, the nice-looking special effect where we have four images
                  sliding to the left every now and then is going to be referred
                  to, as a whole (contained in a wrapper) as the Slider Plugin.
                  I'll just refer to its width:height ratio as its ratio,
                  typically being 2:1.
                </p>
                <p>
                  First issue (easy, and I think it was implemented before), the
                  Slider Plugin seems to have no background color of its own. That
                  is what was making me think it stretches, vertically.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Second issue is that it is only partially handling resizing
                  right. Currently it maintains the aspect ratio, but this causes
                  some cosmetic issues when the browser is at certain sizes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Case 1: If the browser window is resized appropriately, it's
                  possible for the Slider Plugin to fit perfectly within the site
                  so that there is no space between the bottom of the Slider Plugin
                  and the bottom of the browser window (the footer is underneath,
                  and you'd have to scroll to reach it). This is what the site
                  should look like at all times, even when resizing, except for the
                  other case.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Case 2: If the browser window is resized in portrait-like
                  dimensions, y'know, so that the width being smaller than the
                  example above would need to work, it causes the height of the
                  Slider Plugin to decrease, creating space between it and the
                  bottom of the site. Text and the footer would go in that space,
                  so it's entirely okay here.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Case 3: If the browser window is too large, the Slider Plugin
                  starts "clipping" through the bottom of the browser window. We
                  can fix this by limiting the max width of the Slider Plugin
                  (calculated according to the user's browser window height
                  dimension). This would allow case 1 to be fulfilled except that
                  it creates horizontal space to the right of the Slider Plugin.
                  How do we fix this?
                </p>
                <p>
                  We fix this by introducing the Sidebar (for navigation). When the
                  size gets large, we start including the Sidebar and adjust its
                  width to make up the remaining space. That's why it's good for
                  the logo and some text to go in that area. We'll see how it
                  works, it should look good for most sensibly-oriented monitors
                  and at least function correctly for all monitors.
